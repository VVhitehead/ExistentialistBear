#-#-# Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, the definition of "double-think" #-#-#
  The power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind
  simultaneously, and accepting both of them... To tell deliberate
  lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has
  become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to
  draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny
  the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account
  of the reality which one denies all this is indispensably necessary.
  Even in using the word doublethink it is necessary to exercise
  doublethink. For by using the word one admits that one is tampering
  with reality; by a fresh act of doublethink one erases this
  knowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie
  always one leap ahead of the truth.

  Man’s very insides– his self– are foreign to him. He doesn’t know
  who he is, why he was born, what he is doing on the planet, what he
  is supposed to do, what he can expect. His own existence is
  incomprehensible to him, a miracle just like the rest of creation,
  closer to him, right near his pounding heart, but for that reason all
  the more strange. What would the average man do with a full consciousness
  of absurdity? He has fashioned his character for the precise purpose
  of putting it between himself and the facts of life; it is his
  special tour-de-force that allows him to ignore incongruities,
  to nourish himself on impossibilities, to thrive on blindness.

#-#-# Giordano Bruno: His Life and Thought #-#-#
  His home was in a hamlet just outside Nola, on the lower slopes
  of Cicada, a foot-hill of the Appenines some twenty miles east of
  Naples. He tells with affectionate detail of the beauty and
  fertility of the land around, overlooked from afar by the seemingly
  stern bare steeps of Vesuvius. One day a suspicion of the
  deceptiveness of appearances dawned on the boy. Mount Cicada, he tells
  us, assured him that “brother Vesuvius” was no less beautiful and
  fertile. So, girding his loins, he climbed the opposite mountain.
  “Look now,” said Brother Vesuvius, “look at Brother Cicada, dark
  and drear against the sky.” The boy assured Vesuvius that such also
  was his appearance viewed from Cicada. “Thus did his parents
  [the two mountains] first teach the lad to doubt, and revealed
  to him how distance changes the face of things. In whatever
  region of the globe I may be, I shall realize that both
  time and place are similarly distant from me.”

  Around 435 BC, Zeno conspired to overthrow the tyrant of Elea,

  Nearchus had Zeno tortured. Soon Zeno begged the torturers to stop and
  promised that he would name his colleagues. When Nearchus drew near, Zeno
  insisted that the tyrant come closer, since it was best to keep the names
  secret. Nearchus tilted his head toward Zeno. All of a sudden Zeno sank
  his teeth into Nearchus’s ear. Nearchus screamed, but Zeno refused
  to let go. The torturers could only force Zeno to let go by
  stabbing him to death. Thus died the master of the infinite.

  We toiled without rest, told that it’s all a test.

#-#-# Michel de Montaigne #-#-#
  Wherever your life ends, it is all there. The
  utility of living consists not in the length of
  days, but in the use of time; a man may have
  lived long, and yet lived but a little. Make use
  of time while it is present with you. It depends
  upon your will, and not upon the number of days,
  to have a sufficient length of life.

#-#-# Essays of Montaigne #-#-#
  All the whole time you live, you purloin from life
  and live at the expense of life itself. The perpetual
  work of your life is but to lay the foundation of death.
  You are in death, whilst you are in life, because you
  still are after death, when you are no more alive; or,
  if you had rather have it so, you are dead after life,
  but dying all the while you live; and death handles the
  dying much more rudely than the dead, and more sensibly
  and essentially. If you have made your profit of life,
  you have had enough of it; go your way satisfied.

  I fell into a sleep like an idle drone: And as I slept,
  I fell into a dream, I see a Play acted without e're a
  Theam, But I could not tell what the Play did mean. But
  afterwards I did perceive, and something more I did understand;
  The Stage was the World wherein we live, the Actors they were
  all mankind. And when the Play's ended, the Stage down they
  fling, then there will be no difference in this thing,
  Between a Beggar and a King.

  For all his wit, Zeno got himself
  into serious trouble. Around 435 BC, he conspired to overthrow
  the tyrant of Elea, Nearchus. He was smuggling arms to support
  the cause. Unfortunately for Zeno, Nearchus found out about the
  plot, and Zeno was arrested. Hoping to discover who the coconspirators
  were, Nearchus had Zeno tortured. Soon Zeno begged the torturers
  to stop and promised that he would name his colleagues. When Nearchus drew
  near, Zeno insisted that the tyrant come closer, since it was best to keep
  the names a secret. Nearchus leaned over, tilting his head toward Zeno.
  All of a sudden Zeno sank his teeth into Nearchus's ear. Nearchus
  screamed, but Zeno refused to let go. The torturers could only force
  Zeno to let go by stabbing him to death. Thus died the master of
  the infinite.

  Everything a lie. Everything you hear, everything you see.
  So much to spew out. They just keep coming, one after another.
  You're in a box. A moving box. They want you dead, or in their
  lie... There's only one thing a man can do - find something
  that's his, and make an island for himself. If I never meet
  you in this life, let me feel the lack; a glance from your
  eyes, and my life will be yours.

  I am nature's frozen salivation; that which floats
  gently unto the ground, caressing it with winter's fresh
  kiss. I am that which blinds when visible warmth projects
  upon it. I am fragile crystals that form intricately, binding
  together to create a larger formation. I am math, science, and
  art. I am millions upon millions, working in tandem to each
  other to smother and replace, kill and birth, destroy and
  create. I am cold, ferocious, yet soft, and gentle.I am
  unending, perpetual, yet limited in the present. I am
  unique. I am proof of time, and I am salvation.

  You realize people take drugs because it's the only real
  personal adventure left to them in their time-constrained,
  law-and-order, property-lined world. It's only in drugs or death
  we'll see anything new, and death is just too controlling.

  Oh miserable ephermal race, children of chance

  What is best of all is utterly unreachable: not to

  second best for you is - to die soon.

  Whence come the highest mountains? so did I once ask.
  Then did I learn that they come out of the sea. That testimony
  is inscribed on their stones, and on the walls of their summits.
  Out of the deepest must the highest come to its height. Thus spake
  Zarathustra on the ridge of the mountain where it was cold: when,
  however, he came into the vicinity of the sea, and at last stood
  alone amongst the cliffs, then had he become weary on his way,
  and eagerer than ever before. Everything as yet sleepeth,
  said he; even the sea sleepeth. Drowsily and
  strangely doth its eye gaze upon me.

  Virtue for them is what maketh modest and tame:
  therewith have they made the wolf a dog, and man himself
  man's best domestic animal. “We set our chair in the MIDST“
  so saith their smirking unto me "and as far from dying
  gladiators as from satisfied swine." That, however,
  is MEDIOCRITY, though it be called moderation.

  One man looks at a dying bird and

  But death's got the final word.
  It's laughing at him.
  Another man sees that same bird,
  feels the glory.
  Feels something smiling through him.

  We're living in a world that's blowing itself
  to hell as fast as everybody can arrange it.
  In a situation like that all a man can do
  is shut his eyes and let nothing touch him.
  Look out for himself.

  You don't even know it.

  Does your confidence lie in this?
  Are you loved by all?
  Know that l was, too.
